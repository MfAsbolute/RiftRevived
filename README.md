# RiftRevived
I have found a way to revive project Rift I want people to be able to play the old fortnite builds without downtime and without possibility of servers going down (I am in no way trying to steal the developers of Rifts code they own it and can decide to shut this down!)
This project was a server ran program that allows people to re-visit old fortnite builds a while back its servers went offline and to this day they are banning members from their discord there is no way to use project rift however using my smaller than basic logic with code and stuff like that (Im clueless on what im talking about I can just do things not very cool or smart things just things) anyways I found a way to run a type of private server that works with rifts old code but instead of running on their servers it runs much like the fortnite.dev servers however with this you can actually play the game and view old events no downtime no servers shutting down as logn as you have good wifi and a good pc this should work (Still testing what seasons work) again most of the code is made by rifts developers and neonites developers I do not own the code!!!! (Neonites code was also used in this project heres their github: https://github.com/NeoniteDev/neonitev2 they did amazing just like rift their code not mine :p)
Have fun ï¿½:p
